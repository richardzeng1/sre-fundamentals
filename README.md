# sre-fundamentals
This repo contains resources to help ramp up an engineer to start operating like an SRE. This repo is split into two distinct sections: technical knowledge and SRE philosophy. 

## What is SRE?
A site reliability engineer is responsible for production applications and is guided by a simple philosphy: how do we run a reliable, high performing service. The tools and infrastructure we implement is a reflection of this philosphy. It is critical you understand the thinking that guides our work so I recommend you start with the resource.md file. Once you have this background understanding, you will have a better context to understand the tools we use.
