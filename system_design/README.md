# System Design
System design is important for two main areas. The first is during intermediate and senior level interviews. The second area is during actual system designs. This can be for something as simple as a new feature or designing a new product all together. System design is difficult to master because of the breadth and depth of knowledge needed. Some of the common components used in system designs are discussed in this repo but there are way more things to know and consider. The fundamental question that should guide someone during system design is how scalable is the design. Does it need to change if the network traffic is 10x or 100x? Does the Design need to change if there are multiple data centers etc.
